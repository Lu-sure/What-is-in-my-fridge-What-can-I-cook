# What's in my fridge What can I cook

**The project for Kottans FE 2021 Course.**
The app holds the list of products that are in your fridge right now. It's allowed to be edited any time the situation changed. Well, it's all under your control.
Another key feature is picking up some recipes that are available for cooking according to ingredients in your fridge. You don't need to explore cooking books beforehand anymore.

## This app:

1. holds the list of products in your fridge
2. lets you add products to fridge, bought or found
3. lets you delete eaten or spoiled food from the fridge, but only virtually
4. searches recipes to cook by ingredients you choose from the fridge (at least one, 5 ingredient maximum)
5. lets you create your own list of vital products
6. automatically creates a shopping list according to lack of vital products
7. holds own database of products with its units, which eases adding items by letting you choose one from it
8. shows the amount of remaining products in the fridge
9. suggests product names while adding new item to the list

All recipes are taken from [Edamam recipes API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api).
